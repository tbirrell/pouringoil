Let me be upfront about a few things.

This document is operating under the assumption that I am right about religion. Or, more accurately, the Bible is right about religion. If it is right, then this is what it has to say about the future. I am reiterating this because, at a certain point, it will be easy to put this down and say, “that is absolutely ridiculous.” First, It’s only ridiculous if it doesn’t come true. Second, and more to the point, Christianity’s rightness or wrongness has absolutely nothing to do with the nature of events I am describing. It is neither the cause nor effect. But rather, both the truth of Christianity and the truth of these predictions lie on the same road. Therefore for one to be accurate, the other must be.

To this end, perhaps it is worth thinking of this as "In a universe where Christianity is true, this is what will happen." Whether or not that is *this* universe is a discussion for another time.

The purpose of this document is two-fold:

The first is to prepare you. A lot, though not all, of what will happen can be prepared for. Especially at the beginning. As you can see from the list above, things get pretty hairy. But for the first bit, at least, life will be made significantly more manageable with a little heads up and opportunity to get ready. Hopefully, the information in this document can help illuminate some of the proverbial highway signs so that you won't be surprised when the time comes.

The second purpose, admittedly, is to proselytize. I know I said that the discussion for which universe we are is for another time—and I mean that—however, what seems ridiculous looking forward will still be history looking backward. These prophecies are not the foundation of Christianity, not the pavement of our metaphorical road, but they are awfully demanding road signs that tell you which road we are on. They won't be a defense of Christianity until after they come true, but they can still serve as a warning. If you are interested in resources or discussion that can serve as a defense in the present, I am happy to provide both. I don't expect to be around for any of the events I am describing; therefore, any input I would want to offer must be (at risk of appearing to be a lunatic) provided before the fact.

All that being said, *if* the Bible is right about religion, this is what will happen...
