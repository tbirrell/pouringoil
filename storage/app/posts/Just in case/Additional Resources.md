As long as this document is, I have simplified many things to the point of being potentially misleading. Not to say that I'm intentionally wrong, just that I've presented a lot of statements as fact when in actuality, it is somewhat nuanced. While the Bible is 100% correct, I may be wrong in how I've understood some of the finer details and thereby wrong in how I've presented it. I'm not trying to make excuses, but rather show that I've barely scratched the surface. To that end, if you are interested in getting a little more in-depth, I recommend the following books.

**The Tribulation/Revelations**
- The Book of Revelation
- The Non-Prophetâ€™s Guide to the Book of Revelation by Todd Hampson
- The End Times in Chronological Order by Ron Rhodes

**Christianity**
- The New Testament
- The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel
- Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis

**Pre-Rapture**
In case you are interested in further information before the Rapture occurs:
- The Non-Prophet's Guide to The End Times by Todd Hampson
- The Last Hour by Amir Tsarfati
- The Day Approaching by Amir Tsarfati

I also probably gave you this document with a flashdrive. On that flashdrive is a wealth of information from people who have put much more time than I into preparing it. Whereas this document is more for warning, preparation, and a general overview of the Tribulation, the purpose of that drive is to be a resource directly following the Rapture. It has information and guides on Christianity, as well as much more in-depth explanations about what is going on.

In the event that I am still on this earth, either by virtue of the rapture not yet occurring or (God forbid) I get left behind, I am happy to serve as an additional resource and attempt to answer any questions you may have. And if you like, I would also be delighted to send you copies of any and all of the books I've recommended.
