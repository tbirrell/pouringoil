## Pouring Oil
For those of you who are technically inclined, I encourage you to fork and host this website. You can access my repo [here](https://github.com/tbirrell/pouringoil).

The site runs on Laravel 7, which is a PHP framework. I chose this largely because I'm a professional PHP developer, but also because it does not take much to get PHP running. I've tried to make the site able to gracefully fail as more and more freedoms are taken away from Christians. 

*In theory*, it should be simple to host this site using most server hosting providers. Once the crackdown becomes too severe, or Christians are outright banned from the internet, this site should be able to run offline via localhost. This way much of the functionality of the site is preserved, even if its not internet accessible. Then if the day comes where computer access is just impossible everything on this site is in Markdown, so that it retains much of its formatting and remains easy to consume, even if on printed paper.

## Converting to Markdown
If you have not yet reached the stage where you are cut off from the internet and most of modern technology, I encourage you to start converting resources and articles you like into Markdown, or just Plain Text. If you don't understand why, try to copy and paste an online article into Notepad and print it. Sure it probably does the job, but the end result is not something that is easy to work with. And don't assume that you'll always have access to technology like Microsoft Office or Google Drive to handle many of the common formats of today. Someday you'll be on the run, so prepare for that now.

For as long as you have access to a working computer, this site is created to be able to help manage anything MarkDown or Plain Text. So if you start converting stuff, feel free to through it in here (well, a version you are hosting).
